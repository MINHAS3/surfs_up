In the climate analysis all statiion during the months of June and December averaged close numbers in rainfall. The differences is that there are more stations in the specific area to measure the rainfall for June with less for December. The difference in also in the time of the year Summer vs. Winter in the hempishpere. 

The reommendations that I would suggest would be to measure rainfall for longer period of years, 5 years not 1 year. Second recommendation would be two measure the rainfall in major cities in Hawaii not the entire state. Third recommendation is gather data during Hurricane season, when hurricanes have struck the island and how much rainfall was during that time period.
